Projectile Drone
Level: 1d6 + 3
Form: A 3-foot-tall (1 m) collapsible tripod
with a metallic projectile weapon mounted on
top
Effect: It takes two rounds to assemble and set
up this device. Once set up, it takes an action
to activate. When activated, this device follows
whoever activated it around for one hour on
its tripod legs (movement: short). If the user
comes under attack, the drone fires one shot
per round at attackers within long range,
inflicting damage equal to the artifact level.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20
Protection Amulet
Level: 1d6
Form: A stylized amulet worn on a chain
Effect: The amulet reduces one type of

damage the amulet protects against.

Effect: When activated, it solidifes the air in a

substance, and those trapped in it will
likely suffocate or starve.
